# PIC
codes for PIC microcontroller written in assembly 
These are all the codes I've written during my microcomputers course and it includes:

1. multi: multiplication between two binary numbers.
2. div: division between two binary numbers.
3. calculator: division+ multiplication+ subtraction between two binary numbers.
4. led: turning the light depending on a switch button.
5. binary: binary operation with LED bar presentation.
6. counter: counting the number of button presses.
7. keyboard: producing a square wave with different duty cycles (according to the input of the keyboard).
8. BCD: converting from binary to BCD.
9. LCD2: printing character pressed on LCD.
10. LCD3: printing the sum of two binary numbers on LCD.
11. final: the final project was to build a binary processor that executes instructions based on input C on two input binary numbers A and B.
